    "Ans - \n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction is one of the four fundamental principles of object-oriented programming (OOP). It is the process of simplifying complex reality by modeling classes based on the essential properties and behaviors of objects, while ignoring or hiding irrelevant details. Abstraction involves defining a clear and abstract interface for a class, hiding the internal implementation details, and focusing on what an object does rather than how it does it. It helps in managing complexity and allows you to work with higher-level concepts.\n",

    "Q3. What is abc module in python? Why is it used?\n",
    "\n",
    "ans - The abc module in Python stands for \"Abstract Base Classes.\" It provides a way to work with abstract classes and methods in Python. Abstract classes are classes that cannot be instantiated themselves but serve as a blueprint for other classes. Abstract methods are methods declared in an abstract class but do not have a concrete implementation. Subclasses of abstract classes are required to provide implementations for these abstract methods. The abc module is used to enforce abstraction and provide a structure for defining abstract classes and methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the main purposes and uses of the abc module:\n",
    "\n",
    "Defining Abstract Classes: The abc module allows you to define abstract classes by using the ABC metaclass and the @abc.abstractmethod decorator. Abstract classes cannot be instantiated, and they often serve as a template or contract for derived classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Defining Abstract Methods: You can declare abstract methods in abstract classes using the @abc.abstractmethod decorator. These methods serve as placeholders that must be implemented by concrete subclasses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Enforcing Abstraction: The abc module enforces abstraction by raising TypeError if you attempt to create an instance of an abstract class or if a concrete subclass fails to provide an implementation for an abstract method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Providing a Clear Structure: Abstract classes defined using the abc module provide a clear structure for code, making it easier to understand and maintain. They explicitly state which methods must be implemented by subclasses."
